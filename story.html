                <div data-popover-content-for="principles"><h4>Four Core Principles</h4><p>
We have four core beliefs that uniquely shape our culture and the way we work. We call this “FBDS,” and this is the qualification we look for in every person we hire.
<ul> 
<li>Fast: We will seize opportunities to gain competitive advantage.</li>
<li>Brave: We will push clients forward with entrepreneurial passion.</li>
<li>Decisive: We will make the tough decisions in the face of ambiguity.</li>
<li>Simple: We will win with simple innovation – simple to understand, simple to tell, simple to sell.</li>
</ul></p></div>

<div data-popover-content-for="scalable_network"><h4>A Scalable Network</h4><p>
Mediabrands is the fastest growing division of IPG, with offices in 127 markets. We are able to manage Hasbro’s business in practically every corner of the world with limited, if any, ramp-up time, and with the full buying clout, scale, and innovation of Mediabrands. </p></div>


<div data-popover-content-for="capabilities"><h4>The Right Capabilities</h4><p>Initiative is a full service media agency, offering a full suite of communications services, including strategy, planning, buying, digital, content creation and analytics across all media channels. We have a planning approach and a bottom-up strategy that always makes sure no brand is sacrificed on behalf of another. We are creative thinkers and bring our clients innovative media solutions. Our planning and analytics tools, paired with our buying approach, help us get the most out of individual brand budgets. </p></div>


<div data-popover-content-for="experience"><h4>The Right Experience</h4><p>We work with a long list of prestigious marketers across the globe with experience in every category and industry imaginable, including toy manufactures.  In fact, we benefit from working with Hasbro in select markets. But, it is not enough for your media partner to have experience in the toy market. To truly understand shopping habits of kids and moms, Hasbro needs a partner with extensive experience in every segment Hasbro works across, including retail, family-friendly media, and entertainment. </p></div>


<div data-popover-content-for="systems"><h4>The Right Systems</h4><p>Two worldwide planning tools underpin the way we work and ground our advice in consumer-driven fact:
Real Lives: Real Lives is our consumer insight practice. The centerpiece of Real Lives is our proprietary panel, which evaluates 78 consumer touchpoints - and joins that data to who they are, what they feel, and how they use the category.
Matrix: Matrix is our industry-leading, decision-making software that links channel and touchpoint selection with budget allocation and forecasting of communications performance.</p></div>


<div data-popover-content-for="powerful_network"><h4>Supported by a powerful network</h4><p>In addition to the talent and resources at Initiative, Hasbro will benefit from the diverse resources of our parent group, IPG Mediabrands. Through IPG Mediabrands, we have access to a network of best-in-class marketing and technology specialists, including intelligence, new media, technology, retail, content publishing, search, barter, and mobile marketing services. We will help you identify which resources are needed and when, and will ensure seamless integration with the greater team.</p></div>



                <div data-popover-content-for="future"><h4>Building toward the future</h4><p></p></div>

                <div data-popover-content-for="industry"><h4>Recognized by our industry</h4><p>Staying at the forefront of media innovation and strategy, we have collected numerous high accolades across the globe on behalf of our clients. In the last year we’ve won four Silver Cannes Lions, 15 Effies, and various digital awards from Marketing Week and the IAB, and were recognized as Media Agency of the Year in both Poland and Denmark.</p></div>
