    Every year my parents would host a "Labor Day is Lobster Day" pool party and would grill lobsters, steamers, clams etc. We would eat and then go swimming to get clean...followed by a Carvel cake with a lobster on it. I now have the same party for my annual birthday bash :)

    I always wanted to have a Lite-Brite but since the family business included Toy Wholesale and Importing, all I ever got were used toy samples and imported copycat versions which inherently were missing pieces. #stillbitter
